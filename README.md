# Crossbeams::LabelDesigner

The purpose of this project is to collect variable fields and configurations of labels from the clients in a visual way.

Clients can now design the entire label using the drawing tools.

By allowing our clients to indicate where on the designed label template they want the variables to be printed
as well as what font, font size etc. we can generate images to send to the printer to speed up the printing process.
